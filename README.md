# Prolog

relations.erl is a set of rules that will form a family tree with statements from windsor.erl

part2.erl is a natural language processing program that will read in definitions of processors and constraints on the processor attributes: core count, area, and cost. Once several definitions are
specifics and all three attributes are constrained, your program should run a constraint computation to calculate how many of each processor should be placed on a common chip, such that the constraints are satisfied, and return these counts to be
printed.
